To setup Node.js on your laptop for running .js files, you can follow these steps:

01) Go to the Node.js website (https://nodejs.org) and download the appropriate version of Node.js for your operating system.

02) Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Node.js on your computer.

03) Open a new terminal window or command prompt and type node -v to check that Node.js is installed correctly. You should see the version number of Node.js printed to the terminal.

04) Create a new file with a .js extension and write some JavaScript code in the file.

05) In the terminal, navigate to the directory where your .js file is located using the cd command.

06) Type node <filename>.js in the terminal, where <filename> is the name of your JavaScript file, and press Enter. This will execute your JavaScript code in the Node.js runtime environment.

				That's it! You should now be able to run .js files using Node.js on your laptop.
