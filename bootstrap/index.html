            Kubernetes, also known as K8s, is an open-source system for
            automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized
            applications.
          </p>
          <p>
            It groups containers that make up an application into logical units
            for easy management and discovery. Kubernetes builds upon 15 years
            of experience of running production workloads at Google, combined
            with best-of-breed ideas and practices from the community.

          <p>
            Designed on the same principles that allow Google to run billions of
            containers a week, Kubernetes can scale without increasing your
            operations team.
